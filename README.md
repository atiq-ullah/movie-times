# Movie Times

## Description
This project is a learning experiment to learn the basics of the Go programming language. The idea is to scrape movies that are currently in theatres and create a simple and clean UI on a web app that will allow me to book tickets to any movie currently in theatres at any time. This solves the need for me to look at the times for the common theatures that I go to and see them in a glance. Support for theatres will start with just the ones I need and expand as needed.
